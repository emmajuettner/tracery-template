# Tracery Template Project

This is a template for creating static webpages that generate text using a Tracery grammar.
It includes a copy of the [minified Tracery grammar](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery/blob/master/js/tracery.min.js)
as well as jquery,
plus some js code that hooks up tracery to the 'Generate' button, a basic HTML layout, and some minimal CSS styles.
Each time you reload the page or click the 'Generate' button, it will generate a new output from the Tracery grammar.

You can see the template page live [here](). And here's [a real example]() where I've used the template
(with some additional styles) to display my Moby Dick NaNoGenMo tracery grammar.

I put this project together because I wanted to have a quick, hassle-free way to stick a Tracery grammar on a webpage
where people can interact with it. It's mainly intended for my own use, but I figured others might find it useful as well,
so that's why I'm putting it up on Github. Feel free to copy and modify the template to show off your own Tracery projects!
